In the second part, you will use principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images. Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n",

    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, and [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) for scientific and numerical computation functions and tools.

    "### 1.1 Implementing K-means\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data examples together. Concretely, you are given a training set $\\{x^{(1)} , \\cdots, x^{(m)}\\}$ (where $x^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$), and want to group the data into a few cohesive “clusters”. The intuition behind K-means is an iterative procedure that starts by guessing the initial centroids, and then refines this guess by repeatedly assigning examples to their closest centroids and then recomputing the centroids based on the assignments.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is as follows:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K)\r\n",
    "for i in range(iterations):\r\n",
    "    # Cluster assignment step: Assign each data point to the\r\n",
    "    # closest centroid. idx[i] corresponds to cˆ(i), the index\r\n",
    "    # of the centroid assigned to example i\r\n",
    "    idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids)\r\n",
    "    \r\n",
    "    # Move centroid step: Compute means based on centroid\r\n",
    "    # assignments\r\n",
    "    centroids = computeMeans(X, idx, K)\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The inner-loop of the algorithm repeatedly carries out two steps: (1) Assigning each training example $x^{(i)}$ to its closest centroid, and (2) Recomputing the mean of each centroid using the points assigned to it. The K-means algorithm will always converge to some final set of means for the centroids. Note that the converged solution may not always be ideal and depends on the initial setting of the centroids. Therefore, in practice the K-means algorithm is usually run a few times with different random initializations. One way to choose between these different solutions from different random initializations is to choose the one with the lowest cost function value (distortion). You will implement the two phases of the K-means algorithm separately\r\n",

    "### 1.4 Image compression with K-means\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will apply K-means to image compression. We will use the image below as an example (property of Frank Wouters with permission to this class).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Data/bird_small.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a straightforward 24-bit color representation of an image, each pixel is represented as three 8-bit unsigned integers (ranging from 0 to 255) that specify the red, green and blue intensity values. This encoding is often referred to as the RGB encoding. Our image contains thousands of colors, and in this part of the exercise, you will reduce the number of colors to 16 colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By making this reduction, it is possible to represent (compress) the photo in an efficient way. Specifically, you only need to store the RGB values of the 16 selected colors, and for each pixel in the image you now need to only store the index of the color at that location (where only 4 bits are necessary to represent 16 possibilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use the K-means algorithm to select the 16 colors that will be used to represent the compressed image. Concretely, you will treat every pixel in the original image as a data example and use the K-means algorithm to find the 16 colors that best group (cluster) the pixels in the 3-dimensional RGB space. Once you have computed the cluster centroids on the image, you will then use the 16 colors to replace the pixels in the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.1 K-means on pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, images can be read in as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load 128x128 color image (bird_small.png)\n",
    "img = mpl.image.imread(os.path.join('Data', 'bird_small.png'))\n",
    "\n",
    "# We have already imported matplotlib as mpl at the beginning of this notebook.\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a three-dimensional matrix `A` whose first two indices identify a pixel position and whose last index represents red, green, or blue. For example, A[50, 33, 2] gives the blue intensity of the pixel at row 51 and column 34.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the following cell first loads the image, and then reshapes it to create an m x 3 matrix of pixel colors (where m = 16384 = 128 x 128), and calls your K-means function on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding the top K = 16 colors to represent the image, you can now assign each pixel position to its closest centroid using the `findClosestCentroids` function. This allows you to represent the original image using the centroid assignments of each pixel. Notice that you have significantly reduced the number of bits that are required to describe the image. The original image required 24 bits for each one of the 128 x 128 pixel locations, resulting in total size of 128 x 128 x 24 = 393,216 bits. The new representation requires some overhead storage in form of a dictionary of 16 colors, each of which require 24 bits, but the image itself then only requires 4 bits per pixel location. The final number of bits used is therefore 16 x 24 + 128 x 128 x 4 = 65,920 bits, which corresponds to compressing the original image by about a factor of 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can view the effects of the compression by reconstructing the image based only on the centroid assignments. Specifically, you can replace each pixel location with the mean of the centroid assigned to it. The figure below shows the reconstruction we obtained. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/bird_compression.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the resulting image retains most of the characteristics of the original, we also see some compression artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following cell to compute the centroids and the centroid allocation of each pixel in the image."

Note that the `scipy` library also has a similar function to compute SVD `scipy.linalg.svd`. The functions in the two libraries use the same C-based library (LAPACK) for the SVD computation, but the `scipy` version provides more options and arguments to control SVD computation.
