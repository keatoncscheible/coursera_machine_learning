    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties. Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, and [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) for scientific and numerical computation functions and tools. You can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)."

However, to get a better indication of the model’s performance in the real world, it is important to evaluate the “final” model on a test set that was not used in any part of training (that is, it was neither used to select the $\\lambda$ parameters, nor to learn the model parameters $\\theta$). For this optional (ungraded) exercise, you should compute the test error using the best value of $\\lambda$ you found. In our cross validation, we obtained a test error of 3.8599 for $\\lambda = 3$.\n",
