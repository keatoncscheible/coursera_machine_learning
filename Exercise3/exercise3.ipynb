Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, and [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) for scientific and numerical computation functions and tools. You can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)."

We use the `.mat` format here because this is the dataset provided in the MATLAB version of this assignment.

    "**python/numpy Tip:** When implementing the vectorization for regularized logistic regression, you might often want to only sum and update certain elements of $\\theta$. In `numpy`, you can index into the matrices to access and update only certain elements. For example, A[:, 3:5]\n",
    "= B[:, 1:3] will replaces the columns with index 3 to 5 of A with the columns with index 1 to 3 from B. To select columns (or rows) until the end of the matrix, you can leave the right hand side of the colon blank. For example, A[:, 2:] will only return elements from the $3^{rd}$ to last columns of $A$. If you leave the left hand size of the colon blank, you will select elements from the beginning of the matrix. For example, A[:, :2] selects the first two columns, and is equivalent to A[:, 0:2]. In addition, you can use negative indices to index arrays from the end. Thus, A[:, :-1] selects all columns of A except the last column, and A[:, -5:] selects the $5^{th}$ column from the end to the last column. Thus, you could use this together with the sum and power ($^{**}$) operations to compute the sum of only the elements you are interested in (e.g., `np.sum(z[1:]**2)`). In the starter code, `lrCostFunction`, we have also provided hints on yet another possible method computing the regularized gradient.\n",

    "Now you will implement feedforward propagation for the neural network. You will need to complete the code in the function `predict` to return the neural network’s prediction. You should implement the feedforward computation that computes $h_\\theta(x^{(i)})$ for every example $i$ and returns the associated predictions. Similar to the one-vs-all classification strategy, the prediction from the neural network will be the label that has the largest output $\\left( h_\\theta(x) \\right)_k$.\r\n",

    "**Implementation Note:** The matrix $X$ contains the examples in rows. When you complete the code in the function `predict`, you will need to add the column of 1’s to the matrix. The matrices `Theta1` and `Theta2` contain the parameters for each unit in rows. Specifically, the first row of `Theta1` corresponds to the first hidden unit in the second layer. In `numpy`, when you compute $z^{(2)} = \\theta^{(1)}a^{(1)}$, be sure that you index (and if necessary, transpose) $X$ correctly so that you get $a^{(l)}$ as a 1-D vector.\r\n",
